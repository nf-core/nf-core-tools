# nf-core/tools

## v1.1dev
* Improved Python readme parsing for PyPI
* Update linting and release tools to support new style of Docker & Singularity conda installations
* Merged the cookiecutter template into this tools package

## [v1.0.1](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/releases/tag/1.0.1) - 2018-07-18

The version 1.0 of nf-core tools cannot be installed from PyPi. This patch fixes it, by getting rid of the requirements.txt plus declaring the dependent modules in the setup.py directly.

## [v1.0](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/releases/tag/1.0) - 2018-06-12

Initial release of the nf-core helper tools package. Currently includes four subcommands:

* `nf-core list`: List nf-core pipelines with local info
* `nf-core download`: Download a pipeline and singularity container
* `nf-core lint`: Check pipeline against nf-core guidelines
* `nf-core release`: Update nf-core pipeline version number
